# Unitech-recuit

This is a demo project for per-interview test of [UniverseTech](https://www.104.com.tw/company/1a2x6bkmni) in Taiwan.


### Test Requirement
1. Use Github [API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to list your public repositories, including at least repo title, description and url. 

2. Implement one of the techniques
    - Infinite Scrolling
    - Parallax Scrolling

Note that: You should not implement the core of second requirement with any package. It is a ideal choice to use modern framework. It's fine not supporting IE.
